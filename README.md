**Correlation of DCO2 and weight-corrected DCO2 with PCO2**

The file **DCO2corr_Github.ipynb** contains the code used for data processing, statistical analysis and visualization described in the following paper: **_"Weight-correction of carbon dioxide diffusion coefficient (DCO2) reduces its inter-individual variability and improves its correlation with blood carbon dioxide levels in neonates receiving high-frequency oscillatory ventilation."_** *Pediatric Pulmonology*, 2017;1â€“7.

Ventilation data have been downloaded from Draeger Babylog VN500 neonatal ventilator in csv format with 1Hz (1/sec) sampling rate.


This code can be run in IPython Notebook. Running the code required the following packages:

*program* 
Python      3.5.2  
numpy       1.11.1  
pandas      0.18.1  
matplotlib  1.5.3  
scipy       0.18.1


I recommend downloading these packages using the freely availably Anaconda built: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
